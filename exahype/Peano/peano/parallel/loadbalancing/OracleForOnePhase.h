 * their work, shall merge their domains with their master (where this
 * oracle is running on), or whether they should try to fork further. The
 * important operations of this class are OracleForOnePhase::receivedStartCommand(),
 * OracleForOnePhase::getCommandForWorker().

     * this node to fork further, i.e. to reduce its local workload, this might
     * also be relevant to the oracle telling workers of the worker to fork, too.
     *
     * If you wanna keep track of the runtime per worker, the simplest way to
     * realise this is to write a time stamp within this method, as this method
     * is invoked exactly once per traversal.

     * Get command for one single worker

     * This way, Peano asks the oracle how to proceed with the worker
     * workerRank. Shall the parallel travesal simply continue, shall the
     * worker in turn try to fork its partition, or shall the worker merge
     * with the master. The latter is not allowed all the time, i.e. if
     * joinIsAllowed is not set, please do not return Join as result.
     *
     * The operation provides a way to implement dynamic load balancing.
     *
     * There is one oracle per phase, i.e. per adapter. Usually, one or two
     * different adapter coin the runtime, while others have completely different
     * runtime characteristics. An example: For a CFD code for incompressible
     * fluids with an explicit time stepping, the update of time steps and the
     * computation of the right-hand side are rather cheap and/or invoked not that
     * often. Most of the time is spent to solve the pressure poisson equation. As
     * a consequence, the load balancing should only be realised in the oracle for
     * this pressure poisson equation.
     *
     * When you design your load balancing, please keep in mind that the whole
     * Peano code defines a logical tree topology on all the ranks, and that the
     * oracles are not working globally but do exist on each MPI rank. This
     * directly yields the design of getCommandForWorker(): The global automaton runs through the spacetree
     * (or regular grid) top-down. Throughout the top-down steps or traversal,
     * respectively, it invokes getCommandForWorker() for its workers. They then
     * start to traverse their own stuff (and to invoke their own workers in
     * turn). When the local tree/grid is traversed, the node waits for its
     * workers and, as soon as they have finished their stuff, invoked the mapping's
     * receiveDataFromWorker command that you might wanna use to instruct your
     * oracle on further load balancing decisions.
